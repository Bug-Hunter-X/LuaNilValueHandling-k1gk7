This repository demonstrates a subtle error in Lua's error handling when dealing with nil values. The `foo` function is designed to check for nil values and raise an error if `x` is nil. However, the current implementation has an unexpected behavior. The `error()` function terminates the function execution and does not properly propagate error message up the stack. The solution file provides corrected code.
